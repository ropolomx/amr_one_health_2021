# Using CARD to analyze bacterial genomes and plasmids

## Resistome predictions with CARD

CARDâ€™s website provides the ability to:

Browse the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) and associated knowledgebase.
Browse the underlying AMR detection models, reference sequences, and SNP matrices.
Download the ARO, reference sequence data, and indices in a number of formats for custom analyses.
Perform integrated genome analysis using the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI).

### Activity #1: E.coli plasmid

1. Go to https://card.mcmaster.ca/
2. Click on "Analyze" (home page, or top-right corner)
3. You will see two options: BLAST and RGI. Choose RGI.
4. Either upload the E.coli plasmid FASTA file (E_coli_MRSN388634_KX276657.fasta), or enter the Genbank accession number: KX276657.1
5. Select Data Type: DNA Sequence
6. Select Criteria Perfect and Strict hits only
7. Nudge: Exclude nudge
8. Sequence Quality: High quality/coverage
9. Analysis of results: Table view, AMR Genes, AMR Gene Family, Drug Class, Resistance Mechanism. Let's discuss the data visualization and exploring the results.

### Activity #2: Acinectobacter baumannii genome

Similar steps to the approach for E. coli plasmid, except that if you prefer to enter the Genbank accession number, this is: **NC_017847.1**, or you can upload the FASTA file too (Acinectobacter_baumannii_MDR-TJ_NC_017847.fasta)
