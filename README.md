# Bioinformatics for AMR Research

## A workshop for the [One Health Summer Institute's](https://research.ucalgary.ca/one-health/training/one-health-summer-institute) Introduction to Bioinformatics Workshops

## Goals of the workshop

* Overview of methods for bacterial genomics and molecular epidemiology
* Introduction to databases and tools for the analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes

## Workshop program (2021-06-16)

* Introduction and overview of bioinformatics for AMR: methods and databases
* Hands-on activity with the Comprehensive Antimicrobial Resistance Database (CARD): using RGI to analyze genomes and plasmids
* Hands-on work with Galaxy: *de novo* ssembly of a MRSA genome and analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes
